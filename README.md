## 🛠️ Projects

## Projects

### 📉 Credit Risk Scoring Platform
**Probability of default modeling on 1.3M+ loans with production decision logic.**

[Repo](https://github.com/Hussain0327/risk_modeling)

- Built PD model achieving 0.72 ROC-AUC with leakage-resistant, out-of-time validation
- Engineered 50+ features: DTI, utilization bins, loan-to-income ratios, interaction terms
- Mapped predicted probabilities to credit decision tiers (Approve / Manual Review / Reject)
- Identified sub-grade and interest rate as dominant risk factors; addressed 20% class imbalance

**Methods:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, class weighting

---

### 📈 Market Sentiment & Risk Analytics
**Quantitative risk metrics and sentiment-driven trading signals.**

[Repo](https://github.com/Hussain0327/Market-Sentiment-Risk-Analytics) · [Live Dashboard](https://web-iota-three-51.vercel.app/)

- Calculated Value at Risk (Historical, Parametric, Monte Carlo) across 7 equity positions
- Built GARCH(1,1) volatility forecasts for forward-looking risk estimates
- Developed sentiment signal pipeline: FinBERT on financial news → z-score normalization → daily aggregation
- Trained XGBoost direction classifier with 100+ features using walk-forward validation to prevent lookahead bias

**Methods:** VaR, GARCH, NLP sentiment analysis, time series forecasting

---

### 📊 Echo Analytics Platform
**Business intelligence platform with dimensional modeling and KPI automation.**

[Repo](https://github.com/Hussain0327/echo-analytics-platform) · [Live Demo](https://echo-analytics.streamlit.app)

- Modeled customer LTV, cohort retention, and funnel conversion using star schema design
- Implemented SCD Type 2 dimensions for point-in-time historical accuracy
- Reduced reporting cycle time with automated KPI pipelines; benchmarked at 50M rows with 8-40x query speedup

**Methods:** Dimensional modeling, cohort analysis, ETL orchestration

---

### 🛡️ EvidentAI | Open Source
**CI/CD release gate for LLM applications: quality and compliance checks before production.**

[Repo](https://github.com/Hussain0327/EvidentAI)

- Built evaluation framework with PII detection (credit card Luhn validation, SSN format checks)
- Multi-layer prompt injection detection for model security
- 159 unit tests, multi-provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure)
